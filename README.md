### Introduction
GPS sensors are receivers with antennas that use a satellite-based navigation system with a network of 24 satellites in orbit around the earth to provide position, velocity, and timing information. The breakout is built around the MTK3339 chipset, a high-quality GPS module that can track up to 22 satellites on 66 channels, has an excellent high-sensitivity receiver (-165 dBm tracking!), and a built in antenna. It can do up to 10 location updates a second for high speed, high sensitivity logging or tracking. Power usage is incredibly low, only 20 mA during navigation. The following instructions are provided to assist you in developing a GPS sensor that can measure longitude, latitude and many other readings.

> I recommend that before attempting this build that you have accomplished watching videos on [soldering](https://youtu.be/3230nCz3XQA). 

### Bill of Materials
The project's total budget will cost you approx. CAD$218.41 including tax and shipping. The prices can be converted depending on where you are from. If you would like to see my personal budget click [here](https://github.com/rickyramnath97/gps/blob/master/documentation/Rickys%20Budget.xlsx). Keep in mind that my budget costs lower because I own some of the parts (or had access to in Prototype Lab) from the list.

### Arduino IDE Configuration
1. Create your Raspberry Pi's [image](https://github.com/six0four/StudentSenseHat/blob/master/cribpisdcard.md) for your project.

### Soldering and Assembly
1. Make sure to break the 9 pins from the Break Away Header. Then start by soldering the sensor to the pins of the header.
